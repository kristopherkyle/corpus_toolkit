Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet . 
That is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes . 
There are many soft and light shoe leathers available . 
Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers . 
Softness is found in crushed textures . 
Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape . 
Heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette . 
Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights . 
Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes . 
Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps . 
Coolest shade While white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color . 
In the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung-like textures . 
Do n't overlook the straws this year . 
They come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors . 
In the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles . 
For added comfort some of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning . 
The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot . 
Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac . 
In a brighter nautical vein is Ille De France blue . 
Contrast trim provides other touches of color . 
Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black , navy and taffy tan . 
Designed for ease Designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated . 
At the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light , but crisp texture . 
In a lacey open weave shoes have a luster finish , braided collar and bow highlight on the squared throat . 
At right is a casual style in a crushed unlined white leather . 
Flats have a scalloped throat . 
An electric toothbrush ( Broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the American bathroom . 
The brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth . 
In addition , the motor has the seal of approval of the Underwriters Laboratories , which means it is safe . 
The unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in . 
The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor . 
The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own . 
Most of us brush our teeth by hand . 
The same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men . 
The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend . 
In addition , it is small enough to get into crevices , jacket and crown margins , malposed anteriors , and the back teeth . 
The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel . 
It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing , especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly . 
Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device . 
The results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly . 
The electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy . 
But for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury . 
It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles . 
Since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique . 
Turn over writes : Does numbness in the left hand at night , which awakens the person , indicate brain tumor ? ? 
Reply : no . 
This is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand . 
The pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand . 
Steam baths writes : Do steam baths have any health value ? ? 
Reply : No , other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder . 
An ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same . 
Sewing brings numbness writes : What makes my hands numb when sewing ? ? 
Reply : There are many possibilities , including poor circulation , a variety of neurological conditions , and functional disorders . 
This manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer 's cramp . 
Brace for sciatica writes : Does a brace help in sciatica ? ? 
Reply : A back brace might help , depending upon the cause of sciatica . 
Cholesterol and thyroid writes : Does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed ? ? 
Reply : no . 
It usually goes up . 
The cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body . 
It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish . 
The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed . 
The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue . 
There 's more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before , although the spoken rather than the sung word is as old as Thomas Alva Edison 's first experiment in recorded sound . 
Edison could hardly have guessed , however , that Sophocles would one day appear in stereo . 
If the record buyer 's tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric , he will find them satisfied on educational records . 
And he will avoid eye-strain in the process . 
Everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party games has been adapted to the turntable . 
For sheer ambition , take the Decca series titled modestly " Wisdom " . 
Volumes One and Two , selected from the sound tracks of a television series , contain " conversations with the elder wise men of our day " . 
These sages include poet Carl Sandburg , statesman Jawaharlal Nehru and sculptor Jacques Lipchitz , in Volume One , and playwright Sean O'Casey , David Ben-Gurion , philosopher Bertrand Russell and the late Frank Lloyd Wright in the second set . 
Hugh Downs is heard interviewing Wright , for an added prestige fillip . 
There 's more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover Publications . 
Dover " publishes " what the company calls " Listen And Learn " Productions designed to teach foreign languages . 
Previous presentations have been on French , Spanish , Russian , Italian , German and Japanese . 
But the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist 's desire to visit the " smaller , less-traveled and relatively inexpensive countries " , and is now prepared to teach modern Greek and Portuguese through recordings . 
The respective vocabularies " essential for travel " are available in separate albums . 
Thanks to Spoken Arts Records , history buffs may hear Lincoln 's " most memorable speeches and letters " in a two-disc set , interpreted by Lincoln authority and lecturer Roy P. Basler . 
As a contemporary bonus , the set includes Carl Sandburg 's address at a joint session of Congress , delivered on Lincoln 's birthday two years ago . 
For those who " like poetry but never get around to reading it " , the Library of Congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work . 
The program was instituted in 1940 , and releases are available only from the Recording Laboratory of the Library of Congress , Washington 25 , D.C .. A catalogue is available on request . 
Newest on the list are John Ciardi , W.D. Snodgrass , I.A. Richards , Oscar Williams , Robert Hillyer , John Hall Wheelock , Stephen Vincent Benet , Edwin Muir , John Peal Bishop and Maxwell Bodenheim . 
Two poets are paired on each record , in the order given above . 
Decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction . 
RCA Victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called " Adventures In Music " , which is an instructional record library for elementary schools . 
Howard Mitchell and the National Symphony perform in the first two releases , designed for grades one and two . 
Teaching guides are included with each record . 
In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future , Herbert A. Leggett , banker-editor of the Phoenix " Arizona Progress " , reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties . 
One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows , which gave him inferiority complexes . 
Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent , well-informed American . 
But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $ 2,000,000 profit on the stock market . 
Every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb . 
Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough . 
People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's-eye achievements . 
The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it . 
His answer was simple but honest . 
He just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye . 
One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child is a lack of verbal communication . 
The child understands no . 
He senses his mother 's disapproval . 
But explanations leave him confused and unmoved . 
If his mother loves him , he clings to that love as a ballast . 
It motivates his behavior . 
He wants Mommy to think him a good boy . 
He does n't want her to look frowningly at him , or speak to him angrily . 
This breaks his heart . 
He wants to be called sweet , good , considerate and mother 's little helper . 
But even mother 's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior . 
His desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother 's love for him and what she expects of him , in order to overcome them . 
His own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not developed . 
It wo n't develop until he has words with which to clothe it . 
The conscience is non-existent in the 2-year-old . 
What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? ? 
She can decrease the number of temptations . 
She can remove all knick-knacks within reach . 
The fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be . 
She should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child . 
If he ca n't play with Mommy 's magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own . 
If Daddy 's books are out of bounds his own picture books are not . 
Toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove . 
During this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child 's conscience . 
She tells him of the consequences of his behavior . 
If he bites a playmate she says , " Danny wo n't like you " . 
If he snatches a toy , she says , " Caroline wants her own truck just as you do " . 
There is no use trying to " Explain " to a 2-year-old . 
Actions speak louder . 
Remove temptations . 
Remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior . 
Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act . 
He wo n't submit to his natural desires all the time , and it 's Mother 's love that is responsible for his good behavior .
