Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by " technicians with narrow training and little wisdom " are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . 
" It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play " , he commented . 
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . 
" But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop " , he said . 
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . 
There have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . 
" The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries " , Buchheister told the delegates . 
In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil . 
The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society . 
Mrs. Norman Livermore , president of the Marin Conservation League , handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W. Buchheister , president of the Society . 
The presentation was made before several hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney Hall , College of Marin , Kentfield . 
Buchheister pledged the land would be an " inviolate " sanctuary for all birds , animals and plants . 
Seventeen years ago today , German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber . 
The World War 2 , German bomber rolled down a runway and took off . 
The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip . 
This had never been done before . 
Now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed 's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the Navy 's Polaris missile . 
He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 . 
" The first two pilots had crashed " , he said . 
" I had developed the machines and therefore knew them . 
It was time to go up myself " . 
Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler 's super-secret " Reichenberg project " , which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war . 
About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead . 
The target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe . 
The success of the project depended upon Fiedler 's flight . 
Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket 's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude . 
At 12,000 feet , Fiedler signaled " release " , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel . 
To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h .. It was probably man 's first successful flight in a missile . 
" She flew beautifully " , said Fiedler . 
" There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow . 
I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip " . 
Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket 's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage . 
He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h . 
-- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield . 
Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed . 
Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles . 
The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb . 
Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships . 
A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into Allied hands . 
Now a family man with three children , Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale . 
His spare time is spent in soaring gliders . 
" It 's so quiet " , he said , " so slow , serene -- and so challenging " .

Dr. Albert Schweitzer , world-famous theologian and medical missionary , has endorsed an Easter March for Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale . 
Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service , a Quaker organization , will march to San Francisco for a rally in Union Square at 2 p.m. Saturday . 
In a letter to the American Friends Service , Dr. Schweitzer wrote : " Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out . 
" They can not do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack . 
The only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons ; ; otherwise no peace is possible . 
" Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger ; ; therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency " . 
A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a " labor consultant " and operator of a janitors ' service . 
Before he testified for 20 minutes , Stein , who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr. , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums . 
Glimco a buddy Among his gangland buddies , he said , were Joseph ( Joey ) Glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , Gus ( Slim ) Alex , Ralph Pierce , Joe ( Caesar ) DiVarco , and Jimmy ( Monk ) Allegretti . 
Another hoodlum , Louis Arger , drew $ 39,000 from Stein 's janitor firm , the National Maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , Stein disclosed in an interview . 
" I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier " , Stein said . 
" But Arger never was able to produce it , so I cut him off my payroll " . 
Connection is sought Other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including Glimco and Alex . 
The federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing Stein 's fees as a labor consultant . 
Under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to Stein 's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St .. The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick Place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses . 
Lee a witness Among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee , director of McCormick Place ; ; Jerome Leavitt , a partner in the Union Liquor company , 3247 S. Kedzie Av. , Dominic Senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo , onetime gang chief ; ; and Frank W. Pesce , operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm , the Best Sanitation and Supply company , 1215 Blue Island Av .. Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick Place . 
Stein 's fee , Lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors ' pay . 
Stein estimated this amount at " about $ 1,500 or $ 1,600 a month " . 
A $ 12,500 payment Leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $ 12,500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for " labor consultant work " with five unions which organized Leavitt 's workers . 
Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman 's local , the teamsters union , a salesman 's union , the janitors ' union , and a bottling workers ' union . 
Government attorneys , Leavitt said , have questioned him closely about " five or six loans " totaling about $ 40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year . 
All of the loans , in amounts up to $ 5,000 each , have been repaid by Stein , according to Leavitt . 
Stein said he needed the money , Leavitt said , to " meet the payroll " at National Maintenance company . 
The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco 's discredited taxi drivers ' union at 1213-15 Blue Island Av .. The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday . 
The reading , which has been watched with interest since Russia 's detonation of a super bomb Monday , was 4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health . 
The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week . 
A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation . 
Curtis Allen Huff , 41 , of 1630 Lake Av. , Wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association , 1 S. Dearborn St. , where he formerly was employed as an attorney . 
Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $ 20,000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $ 10,000 . 
Lien payments involved Huff 's attorney , Antone F. Gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic 's liens on property on which the association held mortgages . 
Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay " the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living " . 
Huff , who received a salary of $ 109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative . 
Huff lives with his wife , Sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $ 25,000 home with a $ 17,000 mortgage . 
Charge lists 3 checks The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber , an attorney for the association . 
The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18 . 
On that date , according to Gregorio , Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av .. There , Gregorio said , Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense . 
Later , Huff cashed three checks for $ 100 each at the Sherman House , using a credit card . 
All bounced . 
When Huff attempted to cash another $ 100 check there Monday , hotel officials called police . 
Bonn , Oct. 24 ( UPI ) -- Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement under which Germany will pay $ 28,700,000 to Greek victims of Nazi persecution , it was announced today .
