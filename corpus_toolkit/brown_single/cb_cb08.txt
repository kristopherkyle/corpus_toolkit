Old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery . 
She had , she said , heard that the plant was closing . 
It could n't close , she said . 
She had raised a calf , grown it beef-fat . 
She had , with her own work-weary hands , put seeds in the ground , watched them sprout , bud , blossom , and get ready to bear . 
She was ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter . 
She had done it last year , and the year before , and the year before that , and she , and her people were dependent upon these cans for food . 
This did not happen in counties of North Georgia , where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land . 
Nor in South Georgia , where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields . 
This happened in Decatur , DeKalb County , not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian Atlanta . 
And now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the DeKalb County cannery . 
" Is it so the cannery is going to close " ? ? 
O.N. Moss , 61 , tall , grey as a possum , canning plant chief since 1946 , did n't know what to say . 
He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer . 
He did say he was out of cans , the No. 3 's , but " I requisitioned 22,000 " . 
He said he had No. 2 's enough to last two weeks more . 
Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one . 
A three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles O. Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery be closed . 
Reason : the cannery loses $ 3,000 yearly . 
But DeKalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money . 
" The cannery " , said Mrs. Lewellyn Lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the " victory garden " produce , " is a service to the taxpayer . 
And one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put them up . 
It helps those people who help themselves . 
" The county , though , seems more interested in those people who do n't even try , those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food " . 
A driver of a dairy truck , who begins work at 1 a.m. finishes before breakfast , then goes out and grows a garden , and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five , asked , " What in the world will we do " ? ? 
" What in the world " , echoed others , those come with the beans , potatoes , the tomatoes , " will any of us do " ? ? 
Moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , does n't believe it will close . 
But he is in the middle , an employe of DeKalb , but on the side of the people . 
The young married people ; ; the old couples . 
The dairy truck driver ; ; the old woman with the stew . 
" Do n't ask me if I think the cannery helps " , he said . 
" Sir , I know the cannery helps " . 
Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard . 
When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say , " Just forget it " . 
There is one thing I know ; ; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge . 
I know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades . 
Several years ago I was his pastor . 
One night , at the close of the evening service , he came forward , left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to God . 
After almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land . 
" We tried to settle this dispute " , he said , " but could never come to an agreement . 
I settled it tonight " , he continued . 
" I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart , I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor " . 
Forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God . 
You can not wear the banner of God and at the same time harbor envy , jealousy and grudges in your heart . 
Henry Van Dyke said , " Forgive and forget if you can ; ; but forgive anyway " . 
Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness . 
We must , first of all , be willing to forgive others before we can secure God 's forgiveness . 
" For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you : but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive -- your trespasses " . 
Matthew 6 : 14-15 . 
It will do no good to seek God 's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong . 
Then , Jesus indicated that God 's forgiveness is unlimited . 
In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words , " Forgive us our debts " . 
When a person meets God 's requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven . 
God 's mercy and patience will last forever . 
Forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by God 's love . 
It also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past . 
We want the past forgiven , but at the same time we must be willing for God to direct the future . 
Finally , we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us . 
Once Peter asked , " How oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? ? 
Till seven times ? ? 
Jesus saith unto him , until seventy times seven " . 
Matthew 18 : 21-22 . 
Jesus not only taught forgiveness , He gave us an example of it on the cross . 
With all the energy of his broken body he prayed , " Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do " . 
Luke 23:34 . 
She 's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now , although she 's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby , she is getting married . 
Her mother , now dead , was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish said . 
For a while there was such shrill girlish commotion I could n't have made myself heard if I 'd had the equivalent of the message to Garcia . 
But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed , drinking Cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute . 
" How do you know you love somebody enough to get married " ? ? 
She asked . 
It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked : How can you be sure ? ? 
" Are n't you sure " ? ? 
I asked , looking at her searchingly . 
I wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait , to consider , to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important . 
But if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage . 
Besides , in all honesty , I do n't know how you can be sure . 
I do n't know any secret recipe for certainty . 
In the fevered , intoxicating , breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured . 
I knew of but one test and I threw it out to her for what it was worth . 
" Does he ever bore you " ? ? 
I asked . 
" Bore me " ? ? 
She was shocked . 
Oh , no-o ! ! 
Why , he 's so darling and " " I mean " , I went on ruthlessly , " when he 's not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love , is he interesting ? ? 
Does he care about things that matter to you ? ? 
Can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating ? ? 
Because , honey , I thought silently , there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage -- long periods when you 're hopelessly stranded , together . 
And if you bore each other then , heaven help you . 
She came back the other day to reassure me . 
She has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting . 
She asked if I had other advice and , heady with success , I rushed it in , I hope not too late . 
Be friends with your mother-in-law . 
Jokes , cartoons and cynics to the contrary , mothers-in-law make good friends . 
I do not know Dr. Wilson Sneed well . 
But I was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of St. Luke 's Church in Atlanta . 
It was the cry of not just one heart ; ; it spoke for many in the clergy , I suspect . 
The pulpit is a lonely place . 
Who stops to think of that ? ? 
Imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church . 
" Such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments " , he told his members . 
A minister should not stay " beyond the time that his leadership should benefit " his church , he wrote , " for he becomes ordinary . 
" And so the young minister resigned , to go and study and pray , having never passed a day , he told his parishioners , when " I did not gain from you far more than I ever gave to you " . 
His very honest act called up the recent talk I had with another minister , a modest Methodist , who said : " I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love and comfort to other men , and I would have it no other way : and it is unworthy to think of self . 
But oh , how I do sometimes need just a moment of rest , and peace , in myself " . 
A man who gives himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving . 
He does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach . 
The good ones are not motivated to seek vainly , nor are they disposed to covet comfort , or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity . 
Theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards . 
Yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him -- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due , we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul . 
We press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word , and God 's . 
We do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty , but we add to their burden , while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week , American cash . 
If we break the minister to our bit , we are buying back our own sins . 
If he wo n't break , we add to the stress he bears . 
And a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to . 
We expect him to be noble , and to make us so -- yet he knows , and tries to tell us , how very humble man must be . 
We expect bestowal of God 's love through him . 
But how little love we give him . 
The church truly is not a rest home for saints , but a hospital for sinners . 
Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid , and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers , too .
