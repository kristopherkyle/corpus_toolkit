Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question . 
I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy . 
I never found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts . 
But I questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian 's dreamy irredentism . 
Their answer was : it can be done , and we will do it . 
And then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang Kai-shek : " In America " , I said , " practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland . 
What evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done " ? ? 
He smiled . 
( He always smiles -- at least at visitors , I gather . 
He smiled also at a British bloke seated next to me , who asked the most asinine questions . 
I recalled sympathetically the Duke 's complaint in Browning 's " My Last Duchess " . 
) He smiled , and said a word or two to the interpreter , who turned to me , " The President wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei " ? ? 
That , I smarted , is a royal rebuff if ever there was one . 
I answered the routine question about my itinerary , rather coolly . 
Chiang spoke again , this time at greater length . 
" The President says " , the translator came in , " that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in Southeast Asia , and that everywhere you went , you would seek the answer to your question . 
He says that if he were to express to you , once again , his own profound determination to go to the Mainland , and his faith that that return is feasible , he would merely sound redundant . 
So you yourself must seek these objective data , and come to your own conclusions . 
Any information we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal " . 
Fair enough . 
What are the relevant data ? ? 
For every person on Taiwan , there are sixty in Mainland China . 
If the raw population figures are crucially relevant , then it is idle to think of liberation , as idle as to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia . 
Relative military manpower ? ? 
Less than 60-1 , but at least 6-1 . 
The estimates vary widely on the strength of the Chinese army . 
Say four million . 
The armed forces of Taiwan are at a working strength of about 450,000 , though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated . 
Skill ? ? 
Training ? ? 
Morale ? ? 
It is generally conceded that the Formosan air force is the best by far in Asia , and the army the best trained . 
The morale is very high . 
Even so , it adds up to impossible odds , except that the question arises , On whose side would the Mainland Chinese army fight ? ? 
The miserable people of China , the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play , can not themselves resist overtly . 
They think , perforce , of physical survival : everything else is secondary . 
But the army which Mao continues to feed well , where are its sympathies ? ? 
The psychological strategists in Taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivated in China over thousands of years . 
It has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist depersonalization . 
Every soldier in the army has , somewhere , relatives who are close to starvation . 
The soldiers themselves can not stage a successful rebellion , it is assumed : but will their discontent spread to the officer class ? ? 
The immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed : a despot does not economize on his generals . 
But there are the cousins and aunts and nephews . 
Their privations are almost beyond endurance . 
In behalf of what ? ? 
Leninism-Marxism , as understood by Exegete Mao . 
To whom will the generals stay loyal ? ? 
There is little doubt if they had a secret ballot , they would vote for food for their family , in place of ideological purity out on the farm . 
It is another question whether " they " -- or a single general , off in a corner of China , secure for a few ( galvanizing ? ? 
) days at least from instant retaliation -- will defy the Party . 
But the disposition to rebel is most definitely there . 
But there must be a catalytic pressure . 
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal . 
The first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years . 
The family is largely broken up ; ; and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous . 
For it is the family that , in China , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan . 
Now the government must do that ; ; but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained . 
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security . 
The second mistake is Tibet . 
Tibet has historically served China as a buffer state . 
A friendly state , sometimes only semi-independent , but never hostile . 
China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people 's religion and institutions . 
Red China is trying to do this , and she is not likely ever to succeed . 
Tibet is too vast , the terrain is too difficult . 
Tibet may bleed China as Algeria is bleeding France . 
These continuing pressures , social , economic and military , are doing much to keep China in a heightening state of tension . 
The imposition of yet another pressure , a strong one , from the outside , might cause it to snap . 
The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men . 
They know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control . 
First and foremost , they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime . 
On these they feel they can rely . 
Secondly , they depend on America 's " moral cooperation " when the crucial moment arrives . 
They hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly . 
I remarked jocularly to the President that the future of China would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy on an odd day . 
He affected ( most properly ) not to understand my point . 
But he -- and all of China -- wears the scars of American indecisiveness , and he knows what an uncertain ally we are . 
We have been grand to Formosa itself -- lots of aid , and , most of the time , a policy of support for the offshore islands . 
But our outlook has been , and continues to be , defensive . 
A great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr. Kennedy 's views on the world struggle . 
The Free Chinese know that the situation on the Mainland is in flux , and are poised to strike . 
There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation . 
The moment of truth is the moment of crisis . 
During the slow buildup , the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details , fine words , strutting gestures . 
The crisis burns these suddenly away . 
There the truth is , open to eyes that are willing to look . 
The moment passes . 
New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones . 
A truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for a couple of days this month , to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies . 
Before memory , too , clouds over , let us make a note or two of what could be seen . 
The measure was instantly taken , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels . 
One knows better , now , who has bone and who has jelly in his spine . 
But I am here concerned more with policy than with men . 
Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain . 
Now , everyone knows -- or knew in the week of December 10 -- that something had gone shockingly wrong with American foreign policy . 
The United States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful , orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-Western and anti-Communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in Africa , moreover , where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved . 
Of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the United Nations . 
But in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U.S. was in reality the principal . 
The moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our NATO allies , to the entire Western community . 
By our policy the West was -- is -- split . 
But the key revelation is not new . 
The controlling pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis of November 1956 . 
It reappears , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis exposes the reality : in Cuba last spring ( with which the Dominican events of last month should be paired ) ; ; at the peaks of the nuclear test and the Berlin cycles ; ; in relation to Laos , Algeria , South Africa ; ; right now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana . 
What the moments reveal This prime element of the truth may be stated as follows : Under prevailing policy , the U.S. can take the initiative against the Right , but can not take the initiative against the Left . 
It makes no difference what part of the world is involved , what form of regime , what particular issue . 
The U.S. can not take the initiative against the Left . 
There is even some question whether the U.S. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left . 
We can attack Tshombe , but not Gigenza . 
No matter that Gizenga is Moscow 's man in the Congo . 
No matter that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men . 
No matter that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of Western interests in Africa . 
( Even granted that the Congo should be unified , you do n't protect Western security by first removing the pro-Western weight from the power equilibrium . 
) We can force Britain and France out of the Suez , but we can not so much as try to force the Russian tanks back from Budapest . 
We can mass our fleet against the Trujillos , but not against the Castros . 
We can vote in the UN against South African apartheid or Portuguese rule in Angola , but we can not even introduce a motion on the Berlin Wall -- much less , give the simple order to push the Wall down . 
We officially receive the anti-French , Moscow-allied Algerian FLN , but we denounce the pro-Europe , anti-Communist OAS as criminal . 
In the very week of our war against Katanga , we make a $ 133 million grant to Kwame Nkrumah , who has just declared his solidarity with the Communist bloc , and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship . 
As our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-Western Katangans , we stand supinely bleating while Nehru 's troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our NATO ally , Portugal . 
What explains this uni-directional paralysis ? ? 
It is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international -- and in some degree our domestic -- policy . 
The Suez-Hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new Administration , but only made more consistent and more active . 
Key to the puzzles Most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa , Katanga and Ghana , as to the Suez-Hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia , Africa and Latin America . 
From this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the " uncommitted " ( " neutralist " , " contested " ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- Nehru , Tito , Nkrumah , Sukarno , Betancourt , etc . Our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes . 
If we grasp this orientation as a key , our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible . 
And it becomes clear why in general we can not take the initiative against the Left .
