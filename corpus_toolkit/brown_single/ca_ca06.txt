Plainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is " Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism " . 
Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . 
R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . 
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . 
It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women 's Clubs . 
Hughes said Monday , " It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . 
Now he 's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state " . 
Sunday he had added , " We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership " . 
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign . 
" How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this " ? ? 
He asked . 
The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican " and proud to have absorbed his philosophy " while working in his adminstration . 
Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall 's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue . 
Regrets attack Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president . 
" He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign " , he said , " because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign " . 
The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes ' remark . 
Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary . 
He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign . 
State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry . 
Decries joblessness Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate " Must share the blame for this " . 
Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform . 
" But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time " , Mitchell said . 
Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for Mitchell . 
He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises . 
" He calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you ca n't have it both ways " , Jones said . 
The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , " and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue " . 
Defends Ike Earlier , Mitchell said in a statement : " I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes . 
His reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president 's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations . 
" I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste . 
" Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature . 
It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes ' discredit " . 
Sees Jones ahead Sen. Charles W. Sandman , R-Cape May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination . 
Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones . 
Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party 's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years . 
Sandman said : " The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case A[fj] , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway . 
It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he can not answer any questions about New Jersey 's problems . 
" We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington . 
That failed . 
" We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case 's candidacy of last year . 
That , too , will fail " . 
Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee . 
Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women 's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman . 
County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them . 
The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a " lip service word " . 
Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge . 
Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , 1964 . 
Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines . 
The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W. Roos , West Orange public safety commissioner . 
Sheeran , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization 's candidate , Freeholder William MacDonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals . 
" My experience as public safety commissioner " , Roos said , " has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer . 
Jim Sheeran fits that description " . 
Trenton -- William J. Seidel , state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development , has retired after 36 years of service . 
A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state . 
Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies . 
In October 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section . 
Under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting . 
He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station . 
He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens . 
He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education . 
Boonton -- Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge " to carry the issues to every corner of the state " . 
He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn : " When I come back here after the November election you 'll think , ' You 're my man -- you 're the kind of governor we 're glad we elected ' " . 
He said , " We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time " . 
Attacks Republicans In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , " The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary . 
But we 'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform . 
We 'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson . 
" We 'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November " . 
He said , " You can see signs of the Republicans ' feeble attack on the Meyner administration . 
But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead " . 
He urged New Jersey to " become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy " . 
He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry . 
" We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean " , the former Superior Court judge said . 
" To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s " . 
Calling the Democrats the " party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people " , Hughes asked , " a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November " . 
Hughes supported Gov. Meyner 's " Green Acres " plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development . 
He said legislation for a $ 60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday . 
Conservation plan The plan will provide $ 45 million for purchase of open land by the state . 
The other $ 15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis . 
Hughes said , " This is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it " , pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950 . 
He said " Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve " . 
Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved . 
He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans . 
" After the primary " , he promised , " I 'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration . 
I 'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee " . 
Trenton -- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues . 
The outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by . 
There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters . 
A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee . 
She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women 's suffrage amendment . 
She served one four-year term on the national committee .
