Orlando , Fla. , Feb. 2 -- The best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner ( Mainliner-Highland Ellen ) , a member of the Dick Williams stable , who was clocked 2:25 . 
She is owned by Ralph H. Kroening , Milwaukee , Wis. , who , according to the railbirds , can feel justly proud of her . 
Other good miles have been by Debonnie ( Dale Frost-Debby Hanover ) and Prompt Time ( Adios-On Time ) in 2:28-:36 ; ; Kimberly Gal ( Galophone-Kimberly Hanover ) 2:26.2 ; ; Laguerre Hanover ( Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover ) and Monel ( Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd ) in 2:34 . 
Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait . 
This colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them . 
Monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races . 
Stardel ( Star 's Pride-Starlette Hanover ) , 2:34 , looks quite promising . 
Fury Hanover ( Hoot Mon-Fay ) , Caper ( Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover ) and Isaac ( Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover ) has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago . 
Fury and Caper worked in 2:35 and did it with ease . 
They are two good colts of different type . 
Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and Caper is more the compact type . 
I have never seen Caper off his feet -- he seems to know nothing but ' trot ' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so . 
Fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground . 
Trackdown ( Torrid-Mighty Lady ) has worked a mile in 2:33.3 . 
It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace . 
Then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks . 
He has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse . 
Thor Hanover ( Adios-Trustful Hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat bone and excellent feet . 
This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot . 
He appeared in the hopples about November 14 , was treated for worms on the 18th , the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace . 
On December 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twice-around , out in third position all the way . 
This colt has done everything asked of him , and done it with ease . 
His best mile to date is 2:32.2 . 
Gamecock ( Tar Heel-Terka Hanover ) is another promising colt , and his best time is 2:32.2 . 
This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center . 
The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare ; ; the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff . 
The fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman . 
Being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat . 
But up to date he has shown as much as any in the big Simpson stable . 
Hustler ( Knight Dream-Torkin ) is a playful bay rascal of a colt , not the best gaited , but he surely can pace and is right there with them , and sometimes leading them , in the best miles . 
Torrid Freight ( Torrid-Breeze On Hal ) is a very rugged , strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him . 
His best time is around 2:33 . 
Strongheart ( Adios-Direct Gal ) , a fair-looking sorrel colt , knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles . 
Torrid Adios ( Torrid-Adios Molly ) is not so masculine as most of the colts , but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds . 
Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks , he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me . 
First Flyer ( Frisco Flyer-Castle Light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois Stakes . 
His best time is 2:33.2 . 
The colts in Simpson 's stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers . 
Justine Hanover ( Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover ) is improving with each work-out and paced 2:32.4 weeks ago . 
Mrs. Freight ( Knight Dream-Miss Reed ) shows promise and does it in good form , and her best time is about 2:35 . 
Hoopla ( Tar Heel-Holiday Hanover ) , a filly that wanted to trot , knocked herself October 31 and November 1 fighting the hopples . 
She was then trained on the trot until December 29 , hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again . 
This time she submitted and in a few days was going good . 
On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1--:38 ; ; on Jan. 18 2:37.3--:36.1 ; ; on Jan. 21 , , 2:36 . 
This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , Valentine Day and Cerise -- more scale and much better underpinning . 
She is more like her full brother , Taraday Hanover , but larger . 
Up to date she is a grand-looking filly . 
Pete Dailey has four promising 2-year-old pacers . 
Marquis Pick ( Gene Abbe-Direct Grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time . 
He is a fine-looking colt with a good body , good set of legs and nice way of going . 
His best mile to date is 2:28-:33 . 
Majestic Pick comes next , with a mile in 2:30-:33.2 . 
This colt is another fine-looking equine . 
Staley Hanover ( Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover ) is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class . 
Best time to date is 2:34-:34 . 
Step Aside ( Direct Rhythm-Wily Widow ) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows promise . 
Most of Billy Haughton 's 2-year-olds have worked from 2:40 to 2:35 . 
Bonnie Wick ( Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary ) has gone in 2:36 ; ; Hickory Ash ( Titan Hanover-Misty Hanover ) in 2:35 . 
The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself , " that must be Hickory Ash " . 
She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot . 
Hickory Hill ( Star 's Pride-Venus Hanover ) has gone in 2:33 ; ; Hickory Spark ( Harlan-Hickory Tiny ) 2:37 ; ; Buxton Hanover ( Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover ) 2:35 ; ; Faber 's Kathy ( Faber Hanover-Ceyway ) 2:37 ; ; Honor Rodney ( Rodney-Honor Bright ) around 2:40 . 
The last-named is a fine-looking , large colt , who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries . 
He is going sound again now , and looks good . 
Brief Candle ( Harlan-Marcia ) has gone in 2:37 ; ; Lena Faber ( Faber Hanover-Chalidale Lena ) 2:33 ; ; Martha Rodney ( Rodney-Miss Martha D. ) 2:35 ; ; Checkit ( Faber Hanover-Supermarket ) 2:35 ; ; Charm Rodney ( Rodney-The Charmer ) 2:37 ; ; Fair Sail ( Farvel-Topsy Herring ) 2:36 ; ; Custom Maid ( Knight Dream-Way Dream ) 2:34.2 ; ; Jacky Dares ( ( Meadow Gene-Princess Lorraine ) 2:36 ; ; Good Flying ( Good Time-Olivette Hanover ) 2:36 ; ; Bordner Hanover ( Tar Heel-Betty Mahone ) 2:34 ; ; Faber 's Choice ( Faber Hanover-Sally Joe Whippet ) 2:36 ; ; Invercalt ( Florican-Inverness ) 2:35 ; ; Duffy Dares ( Meadow Gene-Princess Mite ) 2:36 ; ; Harold J. ( Worthy Boy-Lady Scotland ) 2:36 ; ; Knightfall ( Knight Dream-Miss Worthy Grapes ) 2:36 ; ; Next Knight ( Knight Dream-Next Time ) 2:36 ; ; Trader Jet ( Florican-My Precious ) 2:37 ; ; Trader Rich ( Worthy Boy-Marquita Hanover ) 2:37 ; ; Good Little Girl ( Good Time-Mynah Hanover ) 2:36 ; ; Iosola Hanover ( Kimberly Kid-Isoletta Hanover ) 2:36 . 
The last-named is one of the favorites in the stable , and the boys like her very much . 
I will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future . 
I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile in 2:34 , last quarter in :35.3 . 
In going away Debonnie got behind several lengths , stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy . 
They left the three-quarters together and finished almost together . 
Prompt Time shows class . 
This filly is another Adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise . 
After well broken and equipped with 12-oz. shoes on behind , bare-footed in front , she would trot a real storm with the master , Delvin , driving . 
Being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled . 
She hesitated , she hopped , she rolled and rocked , skipped and jumped , but in some two weeks she started to pace , From that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds . 
Rain on Friday prevented many workouts , but there were a few miles of note on Thursday . 
Those responsible included Stardel Hanover ( Star 's Pride-Starlette Hanover ) , 2:30-:34.3 ; ; Lorena Gallon ( Bill Gallon-Loren Hanover ) , 2:30-:34.3 ; ; Prudent Hanover ( Dean Hanover-Precious Hanover ) , 2:30.3-:35.3 ; ; Premium Freight ( Titan Hanover-Pebble Hanover ) , 2:30.3-35.3 ; ; Laguerre Hanover ( ( Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover ) , 2:30.3-:36.1 ; ; Monel ( Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd ) , 2:30.3-:36.1 ; ; Fury Hanover ( Hoot Mon-Fay ) , 2:30.3-:36 ; ; Isaac ( Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover ) , 2:30.3-:36 ; ; Caper ( Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover ) , 2:30.3-:36 ; ; Lucky Freight ( Knight Dream-Lusty Helen ) , 2:31.3-:35.3 . 
Sam Caton 's Butterwyn ( Scotch Victor-Butler Wyn ) , a light bay filly , knows nothing but trot and has worked on the half-mile in 2:30-:36 . 
Riverboat ( Dalzell-Cousin Rachel ) has gone in 2:38 . 
Sam is having his troubles with Layton Hanover ( Dean Hanover-Lucy Hanover ) , but hopes to have him straightened out and going before long . 
Jimmy Jordon is high on Adios Scarlet ( Adios-Rena Grattan ) and she sure looks good as she goes by . 
Her best time to date is about 2:30 . 
He also likes Hampton Hanover ( Titan Hanover-Bertie Hanover ) 2:37 . 
Cathy J. Hanover ( Tar Heel-Kaola Hanover ) , formerly called Karet Hanover , has been rather a problem child , but is getting better all the while and can pace a twice around in about 2:31 . 
Armbro Comet ( Nibble Hanover-Mauri Hanover ) has been in 2:38 . 
Flick Nipe 's and Neil Engle 's Miss Phone ( Galophone-Prissy Miss ) is a fine-looking filly with good disposition and good gait , and she has worked up to date in 2:46 . 
Del Mar , Calif. , Feb. 3 -- After 52 rainless days , moisture finally came to Del Mar , resulting in but one workout during the week for most of the horses , and leaving us with less than half our total average rainfall during the season .
