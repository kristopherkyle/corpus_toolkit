Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania . 
Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years . 
Fortunately , it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress . 
Even if you live above that line , the FHA will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged . 
New simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $ 600 to $ 900 . 
Two men can often do the installation in a day . 
You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house . 
Its upkeep ? ? 
No less an authority than the FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs . 
Is it worth-while ? ? 
Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted . 
We know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want . 
We know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling . 
On the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills . 
The filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever . 
Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid . 
Heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat . 
Housekeeping is easier . 
The cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry cleaners , lighter loads for the washing machine . 
The need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent . 
Clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words . 
It will improve your disposition . 
When you 're less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter . 
The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms . 
You 'll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves . 
You can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around . 
Best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford . 
Like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more . 
That brings its per-year cost down mighty low . 
For any house . 
No matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , Colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed . 
The equipment wo n't take up valuable space either . 
It can go in out-of-the-way waste space . 
But there 's no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning is when you build . 
If that 's done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself . 
If you ca n't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later . 
Manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial . 
If your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it . 
This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling . 
You can get year-'round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow . 
The units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area . 
The cooling coil is located in the furnace 's outlet . 
From the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement . 
If you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for . 
Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed . 
They may be inaccessible later . 
Be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling . 
This is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone . 
Be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating . 
You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house . 
For cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water . 
Instead of radiators you 'll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat . 
These systems are more expensive than year-'round forced air systems . 
The minimum cost for an average one-story , 7-room house with basement , is likely to run $ 1500 above the cost of the heating alone . 
Separate systems . 
If the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system . 
The simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit . 
It is , in effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted . 
In a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone . 
In a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the attic to cool the second . 
In each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control . 
The heat pump . 
One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating . 
As you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors . 
A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors . 
Up until recently , this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees . 
Now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees . 
You can get this added heating feature for as little as $ 200 more than the price of cooling alone . 
Consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you do n't want to start up your whole heating plant . 
What size conditioner ? ? 
How large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors . 
Among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family . 
Families with children usually do n't want the house quite so cool . 
If you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity . 
The body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load . 
Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of A[fj] . 
A BTU is a unit of heat , and the BTU rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour . 
A very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you 'll need 15 BTU 's of cooling for every square foot of your house . 
This is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees . 
You 'll need more if the high average is above that , less if it 's below . 
Coolers are also rated by tons . 
A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice . 
By accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12,000 BTU of cooling in one hour . 
You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower . 
It is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you 'll get . 
A 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 BTU to well over 10,000 A[fj] . 
The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself . 
Do n't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough . 
Better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big . 
Here 's why : Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling . 
An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period . 
Before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low . 
With a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature . 
Money-saving tips . 
Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately . 
A well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $ 128 a year , or $ 11 a month . 
If you have a house which heat does n't penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove . 
Keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you 've won the first battle . 
In a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution . 
If the house you plan to buy or build wo n't have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings . 
Shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can . 
Drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house . 
The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact . 
The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you 're going to need . 
A shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money . 
You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation . 
Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house . 
They 're easier to shade there . 
An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool . 
You 'll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one . 
Gas adds to the moisture load . 
Insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum . 
In insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 . 
They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors . 
Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling . 
A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent . 
It costs two to three times as much to remove a BTU in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary BTU is worth attention . 
You 'll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier . 
Keeping conditioners quiet . 
It 's no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum . 
Good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you 're doing your own contracting , do n't award the job on the basis of price alone . 
Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom .
