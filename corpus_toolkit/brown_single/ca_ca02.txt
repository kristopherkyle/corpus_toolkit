Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel 's " abandoned property " act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . 
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . 
Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . 
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . 
Daniel termed " extremely conservative " his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . 
He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books " since Texas was a republic " . 
It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . 
The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . 
The escheat law can not be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . 
Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . 
" If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy " , he said . 
" You take out of circulation many millions of dollars " . 
Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount " to making a gift out of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies " . 
His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J.B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin . 
Cox argued that the bill is " probably unconstitutional " since , he said , it would impair contracts . 
He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . 
Austin , Texas -- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . 
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . 
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . 
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here . 
Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $ 451,500 , which would be a savings of $ 157,460 yearly after the first year 's capital outlay of $ 88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . 
The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school . 
Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V.E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff . 
While details are still to be worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry 's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . 
" We 're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting " , said Ratcliff . 
" But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also . 
I 'm willing to stake my political career on it " . 
Rep. Berry , an ex-gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies . 
A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later . 
The house passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department 's authority to give planning assistance to cities . 
The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . 
One validated acts of school districts . 
Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District . 
The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . 
Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen. A.R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district . 
Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . 
Two tax revision bills were passed . 
One , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . 
Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $ 1,000 fine . 
It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League . 
The other bill , by Sen. A.M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $ 12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds . 
Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3 , of El Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas . 
Marshall Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . 
Under Formby 's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the House , attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court . 
Austin , Texas -- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . 
An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . 
Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . 
The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . 
The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . 
Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . 
All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep. Bill Jones , who was absent . 
Austin , Texas -- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas ' big cities Thursday . 
Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 people . 
When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas . 
Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse . 
The bill would increase from $ 5,000,000 to $ 15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project . 
Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . 
Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten 's attack . 
The bill 's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J.W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs . 
" This is a poor boy 's bill " , said Chapman . 
" Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds . 
This would help the little peanut districts " . 
Austin , Texas -- A Houston teacher , now serving in the Legislature , proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning " educational methods " . 
Rep. Henry C. Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called " teaching methods " courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate . 
A normal year 's work in college is 30 semester hours . 
Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching . 
The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects . 
" A person with a master 's degree in physics , chemistry , math or English , yet who has not taken Education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools " , said Grover . 
College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses . 
Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal .

Denton , Texas ( sp . 
) -- Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62 session upon the recommendation of Supt. Chester O. Strickland . 
State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a " blue ribbon " citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program . 
The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load . 
The report called racial discrimination in employment " one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency " . 
" Must solve problem " The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co. , committee chairman . 
" We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence " , Martin said . 
The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . 
These , he said , are " two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC " . 
Calls for extension Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . 
Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy .
