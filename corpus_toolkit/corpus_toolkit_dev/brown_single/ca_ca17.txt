Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army 's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St .. The pert , gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo , N.Y. , is a " civilian " with the Army . 
Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director . 
The job also covers a number of other items . 
" Mom " Marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society . 
Her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs. Marr 's office is always open and the welcome mat is out . 
Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up . 
She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures . 
" Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men " , Mrs. Marr explained . 
The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center . 
" And I bum tickets to everything I can " , she said . 
" I 've become the greatest beggar in the world " . 
In addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system . 
Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to " mother " , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society . 
By mid-June , millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land . 
In another four weeks , with schools closed across the nation , the great all-American summer safari will be under way . 
By July 1 , six weeks from now , motel-keepers all over the nation will , by 6 p.m. , be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign , " No Vacancy " . 
No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer , probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car , throw suitcases , kids and comic books in the back seat , and head for home . 
And where is " home " , that magic place of the heart ? ? 
Ah , that is simple . 
Home is where a man was born , reared , went to school and , most particularly , where grandma is . 
That is where we turn in the good old summertime . 
The land lies ready for the coming onslaught . 
My husband and I , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson , Ariz. , to New York City : set for influx I can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting . 
I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations . 
Maybe motel-keeping is n't the nation 's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway . 
There are motels for all purposes and all tastes . 
There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock , Tex. , as I discovered . 
There the Royal Motel advertises " all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free TV , storm cellar " . 
Many with pools Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( " swim at your own risk " is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . 
Some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children . 
But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar . 
Motorists like myself who can remember the old " tourists accommodated " signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business . 
All for $ 14 ! ! 
At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester , Va. , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels . 
All for $ 14 . 
That made up for the " best " motel in Norman , Okla. , where the proprietor knocked $ 2 off the $ 8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture .
