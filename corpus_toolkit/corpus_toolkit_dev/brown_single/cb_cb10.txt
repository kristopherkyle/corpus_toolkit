Miami , Fla. , March 17 . 
An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year . 
Now Richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go . 
He can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa . 
This happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece . 
" It 's a whole lot easier " , he said , " to increase the population of Nevada , than it is to increase the population of New York city " . 
And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher . 
" That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote " , said the writer , scratching his head . 
" Now , if I can just figure out what he 's talking about , I 'll use it " . 
Two spots open This was just Richard 's way of saying that last year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open . 
Some brilliant rookies nailed them down , so that this spring just two spots , left and right field , are really up for grabs . 
It should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year , but so far it has n't worked that way . 
This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one . 
You 'd never guess it from the way they 've played so far this spring , but there remains a feeling among some around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 . 
Obviously , if this club is going to move from second to first in the American League , it will have to show improvement someplace . 
Where can that improvement possibly come from ? ? 
You certainly ca n't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year . 
Robby could be better . 
Brooks Robinson is great , and it is conceivable that he 'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960 . 
You ca n't expect it , though . 
Robby 's performance last year was tremendous . 
It 's the same with Ron Hansen and Jim Gentile . 
If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint . 
They should n't be asked to carry any more of the burden . 
Hansen will be getting a late spring training start , which might very well set him back . 
He got off to an exceptional start last season , and under the circumstances probably wo n't duplicate it . 
There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year . 
They do n't expect to stop him , just slow him down some with the bat . 
He 'll still be a top player , they concede , because he 's got a great glove and the long ball going for him . 
But they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production . 
Breeding might move up . 
Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs . 
Do n't ask him more . 
I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch . 
But even so , he had a good year in 1960 and wo n't do too much better . 
So , all in all , the infield ca n't be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second to first . 
And the pitching will also have trouble doing better . 
Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season . 
Where , then , can we look for improvement ? ? 
" From Triandos , Brandt and Walker " , answers Richards . 
" They 're the ones we can expect to do better " . 
The man is right , and at this time , indications are that these three are ready for better seasons . 
Triandos has n't proved it yet , but he says he 's convinced his thumb is all right . 
He jammed it this spring and has had to rest it , but he says the old injury has n't bothered him . 
If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively . 
I 'm still not convinced , though , I 'll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him . 
Hank Foiles , backed up by Frank House who will be within calling distance in the minors , make up better second line catching than the Birds had all last year , but Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant . 
To me , Brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year . 
He has n't played too much , because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice . 
He 's hitting the ball hard , in the batting cage , and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year . 
When he came to Baltimore , he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the National League pennant , and he was joining what seemed to be a second division American League club . 
He was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field . 
As of now , that all seems behind him . 
He 's been entirely different all spring . 
And Walker looks stronger , seems to be throwing better than he did last year . 
Let him bounce back , and he could really set up the staff . 
So , if the Orioles are to improve , Brandt , Triandos and Walker will have to do it . 
So far the platoons on left and right fielders do n't seem capable of carrying the load . 
Of course , this is n't taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New York city , but it 's the way things look from here at this point . 
Is the mother of an " autistic " child at fault ? ? 
( The " autistic " child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self . 
He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people . 
) Did his mother make him this way ? ? 
Some people believe she did . 
We think differently . 
We believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , is to a large extent inborn . 
A mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties . 
Sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them . 
But we do n't think she creates them . 
We do n't think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic . 
The mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often , by sharing her experiences , she can help other mothers with the same problem . 
Since little is known about autism , and almost nothing has been written for the layman , we 'd like to share one experienced mother 's comments . 
She wrote : total disinterest " . 
As the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything , I have to manipulate my son 's fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy . 
He wants me to do everything for him . 
" You do n't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them . 
But I do and my psychiatrist does , too . 
I know , that my son wants control and direction , but being autistic myself I can not give full control or direction . 
" One thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned . 
This is that autistic people do n't enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance , my children and I . 
When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board . 
He pushes and straightens himself as if he ca n't stand the feeling of being held . 
Physical contact is uncomfortable for him " ! ! 
This mother is quite correct . 
As a rule , the autistic child does n't enjoy physical contact with others . 
Parents have to find other ways of comforting him . 
For the young child this may be no more than providing food , light or movement . 
As he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his " magic " thing ) . 
Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick . 
The answer is different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer . 
Only ingenuity will uncover it . 
What future holds " Dear Doctors : We learned this year that our older son , Daniel , is autistic . 
We did not accept the diagnosis at once , but gradually we are coming to . 
Fortunately , there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend , with a group of normal children . 
" I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal , though of course I realize he is far from that at present . 
What I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible . 
I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible . 
" What is your experience with autistic children ? ? 
How do they turn out later " ? ? 
Many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives . 
Certainly , most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people , but many adjust to school , even college , to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood . 
Single-color use question -- A first grader colors pictures one solid color , everything -- sky , grass , boy , wagon , etc .. When different colors are used , she is just as likely to color trees purple , hair green , etc .. The other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color . 
Should I show my daughter how things should be colored ? ? 
She is an aggressive , nervous child . 
Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits ? ? 
Answer -- Her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring , without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects . 
This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade . 
No , coloring is n't exactly something you teach a child . 
You sometimes give them a little demonstration , a little guidance , and suggestions about staying inside the lines . 
But most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration . 
Seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art : embroidery . 
Possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms , which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed . 
Just as a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme , so may some of the newest versions of embroidery . 
One such , in fact , is a rug . 
Though not actually crewel embroidery , it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue , pink , bronze and gold and a sauterne background . 
The twirled , stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in England . 
Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country . 
The work is executed in England ( by hand ) and can be worked in any desired design and color . 
Among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color . 
Chinese influence For a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine English Chippendale furniture , fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired design of this revered Eighteenth Century period . 
Since the work is done by hand , the only limitation , it is said , " is that of human conception " . 
Modern embroidered panels , framed and meant to be hung on the wall , are another aspect of this trend . 
These have never gone out of style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts . 
An amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings , and , by picking up her living room color scheme , add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room .
