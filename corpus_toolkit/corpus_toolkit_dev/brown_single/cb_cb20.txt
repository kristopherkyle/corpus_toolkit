Escalation unto death The nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets -- not yet . 
It is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories . 
They predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting . 
The biggest nuclear device the United States has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our B-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece . 
Some time ago , however , Mr. Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the Soviet Union would make them . 
He seems to have at least a few 30 - and 50-megaton bombs on hand , since we can not assume that he has exploded his entire stock . 
And now , of course , the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side . 
Khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb ? ? 
So be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing . 
So escalation proceeds , ad infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds . 
What is needed , Philip Morrison writes in The Cornell Daily Sun ( October 26 ) is a discontinuity . 
The escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon . 
" Only a discontinuity can end it " , Professor Morrison writes . 
" The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy " . 
Morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red China , it is the most vulnerable of the great powers -- Europe of course must be written off out of hand . 
He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the least risky path our government can take . 
His proposal is opposed to that of Richard Nixon , Governor Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic Energy Commission , Dr. Edward Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war . 
These gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing -- in the atmosphere -- on the greatest possible scale , all in the name of national security . 
Escalation is their first love and their last ; ; they will be faithful unto death . 
Capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation 's security are incapable of learning , or even of observing . 
If this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation . 
He has gained only one thing -- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges . 
But if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously . 
Not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere . 
Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps . 
When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural . 
Thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable . 
But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . 
The tide turns When East Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists . 
They are less vocal now , when it is the West Berliners who are migrating . 
The flood is not as great -- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account -- but it is symptomatic . 
West Berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable . 
Nearly 18 per cent of West Berlin 's 2,200,000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per cent are under fifteen . 
R. H. S. Crossman , M.P. , writing in The Manchester Guardian , states that departures from West Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1,700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1,900 a week . 
The official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people . 
Whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead . 
The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that " The closing off of East Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . 
The gallant half-city is dying on its feet " . 
Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in The Observer ( London ) . 
Mark Arnold-Foster writes : " People are leaving ( West Berlin ) because they think it is dying . 
They are leaving so fast that the president of the West German Employers ' Federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six months ' front-line work in factories in West Berlin . 
Berlin 's resilience is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle will be hard indeed " . 
The handwriting is on the wall . 
The only hope for West Berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city . 
State Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into East Berlin under military escort , will not avail . 
Tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful . 
The materials for compromise are at hand : The Nation , Walter Lippmann and other sober commentators ( see Alan Clark on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again and again . 
A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save Berlin . 
Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence , if that is what the West wants . 
Vacancy The removal of Stalin 's body from the mausoleum he shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history . 
It is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead . 
A British writer , Richard Haestier , in a book , Dead Men Tell Tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding the French Revolution the body of Henry 4 , , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob . 
And in England , after the Restoration , the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn . 
The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows . 
Contemplating these posthumous punishments , Stalin should not lose all hope . 
In 1899 , Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster , facing Whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands . 
Nikita Khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself . 
The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , Moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of Communism deplores waste . 
Who will take Stalin 's place beside Lenin ? ? 
There is Karl Marx , of course , buried in London . 
The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable . 
Who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin ? ? 
Who but Nikita himself ? ? 
Since he has just shown who is top dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the Soviet people . 
Besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life . 
Suppose he did lie beside Lenin , would it be permanent ? ? 
If some future Khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? ? 
When a man is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put . 
If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand . 
U Thant of Burma The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.N. 's Acting Secretary General -- at this writing , the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends . 
Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites in the running , but France did n't like the former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter . 
With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr. Hammarskjold , U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto . 
What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . 
In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . 
He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future . 
He is a Buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung . 
U Thant of course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr. Hammarskjold 's term would have come to an end . 
Whether the compromises -- on both sides -- that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen . 
Mr. Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U Thant represents . 
In a sense , the showdown promised by Mr. Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; ; no precedents have been set as yet ; ; structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it . 
But at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong . 
To the hills , girls . 
No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade . 
These are mentalities which crave action -- and they are beginning to get it , as Messrs. Salsich and Engh report on page 372 . 
Even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ? 
) left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading . 
Friends , a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the Gulf Telephone Company at Foley , Alabama . 
" If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast " , the account reads , " they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls . 
Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving Civil Defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute 's notice " . 
According to Friends , the unit was organized by John Snook , a former World War 2 , commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company . 
The girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck ; ; they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies ' accessories . 
This may be opera bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy . 
The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means . 
The doctrine has never worked ; ; it is not working now . 
The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; ; it can not bring them into actual play . 
A more dangerous formula for national frustration can not be imagined . 
As the civic temper rises , the more naive citizens begin to play soldier -- but the guns are real . 
Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst .
