Thirty-three Scotty did not go back to school . His parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University Hospital -- Mr. McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family -- and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty much as he chose -- provided , of course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating . His teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that , if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little danger of his losing a term . 
====
Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments . 
====
He was discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley described as a " celebration lunch " at the cafeteria on the campus . Rachel wore a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick . Scotty 's father sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship . 
====
Teachers -- men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles -- came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel . Rachel was polite , Scotty indifferent . They ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces and Scotty gazed without interest at his food , the teachers , the heroic baronial windows , and the bright ranks of college banners . His father tried to make the food a topic . 
====
" The blueberry pie is good , Scotty . I recommend it " . He looked at his son , his face worried . Scotty murmured , " No , thanks " , so softly his father had to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him . Scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment of interest . He said more loudly , " I 'm full , old Pop " . He had eaten almost nothing on the crested , three-sectioned plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper container . 
====
" He 's all right , Craig " , Rachel said . " I can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home " . 
====
Since his seizure , Scotty had had little appetite ; ; yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , was one of plumpness . His face was fuller ; ; his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking . He breathed now with his mouth open , showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth ; ; he kept his eyes , with their puffed blurred lids , always lowered , though not , apparently , focusing . Even his neck seemed thicker and , therefore , shorter . His hands , which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering birds , were now neither active nor really relaxed . They lay on his lap , palms up , stiffly motionless , the tapered fingers a little thick at the joints . Altogether he had , since the seizure , the appearance of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise . He looked lazy , spoiled , a little querulous . 
====
Rachel had little to say . She greeted her husband 's colleagues with smiling politeness , offering nothing . Mr. McKinley , for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity , was completely alert to his son , eyes always on the still face , jumping to anticipate Scotty 's desires . It was a strained , silent lunch . 
====
Rachel said , " I 'd better get him to bed " . 
====
The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger . 
====
Since Mr. McKinley had to give a lecture , Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth . They did not speak much . Scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and said softly , " Look at those stupid kids " . It was a Negro section of peeling row houses , store-front churches and ragged children . Rachel had to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat . He said , " Nothing " . And then : " There are lots of kids around here " . 
====
Scotty looked at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull . He felt tired and full and calm . 
====
Thirty-four the days seemed short , perhaps because his routine was , each day , almost the same . He rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel . Virginia treated him with attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food : biscuits , cookies , candies -- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen . She would hover over him and , looking like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of Scotty 's fork or spoon . 
====
" You do n't eat enough , honey . Try to get that down " . 
====
Rachel , observing , would say , " He has to rediscover his own capacity . It 'll take time " . 
====
Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now , as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere . Both watched Scotty constantly , Rachel without seeming to , Virginia openly , her eyes filled with concern . Scotty was neutral . He did not resent their supervision or Virginia 's sometimes tiring sympathy . He ate what he felt like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow , dubious steps , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral . His energy was gone . He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving . His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly -- they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite -- folded in his lap ; ; his mouth hung slightly open . When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder . 
====
He had not mentioned Kate . He had not even thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly , almost accidentally , encounter her . At these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest , but it was an objective pain , in no way different from others in intensity and not different in kind ; ; it was like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throbbed ; ; it was merely another part of his weakness . He was calm , drugged , and lazy . He did not care . 
====
Rachel mentioned Kate . She said , " I notice the girl from across the street has n't bothered to phone or visit " . 
====
Scotty said , " That 's all right . Kate 's all right " . He thought about it briefly , then deliberately turned the talk to something else . 
====
Once , sitting at the front window in his parents ' room , he saw Kate come out of her house . She was with Elizabeth . They were far off and looked tiny . The heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them . They turned at the bottom of Kate 's steps and moved off in the direction of the park . He thought he saw -- it awakened and , for a moment , interested him -- that Elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash . Then they disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed . By the time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate . 
====
The doctor , since Scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him , came often and informally to the house . He would sit , slim-waisted and spare , on the edge of Scotty 's bed , his legs crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor . Scotty did not mind the doctor 's unsmiling teasing as he used to . 
====
" Husky young man " , he said with mock distaste . " I imagine you 're always battling in school " . 
====
" I do n't go to school any more " . 
====
" Pardon " ? ? The doctor had to bend close to hear ; ; his delicate hand , as veined as a moth 's wing , rested absently on Scotty 's chest . Scotty said the same words more loudly . " Oh . Well , we 're taking a little vacation , that 's all " . He turned unsmilingly to Rachel . " I think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little . He could now but the weakness is very definite ; ; it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily . He 'll be stronger soon " . His stethoscope was on the table by Scotty 's bed and he picked it up and wagged it at Scotty . He said fussily , " Just keep the cap on those strong emotions " . The stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room . " I 'll drop by again in a few days " . 
====
Rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone . She smoothed the covers on Scotty 's bed and picked things up from the floor . She did not touch him . Scotty watched with disinterest . He did not speak . He had no desire to . 
====
She said , " Do you think you 'll miss school " ? ? 
====
He had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel had grown . He did not care . He felt her irritability did not concern him , yet he knew he would not care even if it did . He shook his head . 
====
" We 've had any number of calls about you . You could win a popularity contest at that school without any trouble . Miss Estherson called twice . She wants to pay you a visit . She says the children miss you . Apparently you were the light of their lives " . 
====
Scotty shrugged slightly . Rachel came close to the bed , bent as if she would kiss him , then moved away . She was frowning . " That doctor annoys me " . She seemed to speak to herself . " Do you suppose his self-consciousness is characteristic of the new Negro professionals or merely of doctors in general " ? ? 
====
She turned to him again . " Well , Mrs. Charles -- Sally -- has phoned too . She was very worried " . Rachel 's tone was dry . " She did n't really say " -- She glanced away at the floor , then swooped gracefully and picked up one of Scotty 's slippers . " I mean , do you feel like seeing Kate " ? ? 
====
Scotty said , " I do n't know " . It was true . He did not . There was the slight pain , but it was no different from the throbbing in his head . 
====
" Well , there 's time , in any case . We 'll wait till you 're stronger and then talk about it " . She put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed . 
====
Scotty said , " Okay " . 
====
This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead . Scotty was pleased . 
====
His father was a constant visitor . Scotty would hear the front door in the evening and then his father 's deep slow voice ; ; it floated up the stairs . 
====
" How 's Scotty " ? ? 
====
And Rachel 's or Virginia 's reply : " better . He 's getting plenty of rest " . 
====
" Is his appetite improved " ? ? Or : " Does he get exercise " ? ? 
====
The exchange was almost invariable , and Scotty , in his bed , could hear every word of it . He never smiled . It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father . His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look at his son . After a pause , during which he studied Scotty 's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too , Mr. McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs . 
====
Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat . 
====
" I 'm eating more " , he would say . Or : " I walk around the house a lot " . 
====
" Perhaps you should get out a little " . 
====
" I 'm not supposed to yet " . He was not irritated . He did not mind the useless , kindly questions . He looked at the lined face with vague interest ; ; he felt he was noting it , as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger . 
====
Mr. McKinley examined everything with critical care , seeking something material to blame for his son 's illness . 
====
" Have you got enough blankets " ? ? And another time , without accusation : " You never wore that scarf I bought you " .
