Note : Directions are written for those who have had previous experience in making pottery . 
Instructions for preparing clay , drying , glazing and firing are not given . 
Equipment : Basic pottery studio equipment . 
Wooden butter molds and cookie presses . 
Materials : Ceramic modeling clay : red , white or buff . 
Stoneware clay for tiles . 
Glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions . 
General directions : Use well-wedged clay , free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking . 
Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly ; ; they must be free of oil , wax and dust . 
Pressing designs : The size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed . 
Roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions . 
Whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay . 
When mold has more than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns . 
Place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects ; ; experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ) . 
Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold . 
To obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , starting at center and working to outer edges . 
Trim excess clay away from outer edges . 
Check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay . 
Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles . 
Allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) . 
To release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project ; ; gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold . 
Slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold . 
Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action . 
This will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired . 
Place project on table and carefully lift the mold off . 
Study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections . 
If clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers . 
If the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush . 
Make slight , smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) . 
Leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping . 
Rectangular tiles ( opposite page , right top ) : Stoneware clay was used . 
Clay was rolled to 14 " " thickness . 
Back of clay scored or roughened for proper gripping surface . 
No bisque firing . 
Glazed with two coats of Creek-Turn white stoneware glaze ( no glaze on sides or bottom ) .

Round plaque ( opposite page , bottom ) : White clay was used , rolled to 14 " " thickness . 
Bisque fired to cone 05 . 
Stained with Jacquelyn 's ceramic unfired stain , polished , following manufacturer 's directions . 
Opaque cantaloupe and transparent wood brown were used . 
No further firing . 
Paperweight ( opposite page , top left ) : Red clay was used , rolled 12 " " thick . 
Mold was used as pattern and clay cut by holding knife at about 45-degree angle , to form an undercut , making base smaller than the pattern top . 
While clay is still pressed in mold , press three equally spaced holes 14 " " deep , using pencil eraser , in bottom of clay to allow for proper drying and firing . 
Paperweight may be personalized on back while clay is leather hard . 
Bisque fired to cone 05 . 
Unglazed . 
Jars with lids ( opposite page , top left ) : Remove wooden design head from bowl of butter mold . 
Fill small hole in bowl with clay . 
Make paper patterns for sections of jar and lid ( see Fig. 1 , opposite page ) . 
Measurements for rectangular pattern piece A are obtained by measuring inside circumference and depth of butter mold bowl . 
Pattern for circular base piece B is diameter of A[fj] . 
Use wooden design head of mold for pattern C ; ; pattern D for lid fits over top diameter of A[fj] . 
Pattern for inner lid piece E fits inside A[fj] . 
Jars are assembled in bowl of butter mold . 
Use white or buff clay , rolled to 316 " " thickness . 
Place patterns on rolled clay and cut around them with knife in vertical position . 
Place clay pieces on wall board . 
To assemble jar , put paper pattern B for base in bottom of mold and clay disk B on top . 
Line sides of mold with paper pattern A[fj] . 
Bevel and score ends of clay piece A so that they overlap about 12 " " and make even thickness . 
Place clay piece A inside ; ; use slip to join overlapped ends together . 
Join B to bottom of A , scoring and reinforcing with clay coil . 
Trim excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside while assembling lid . 
To assemble lid , press clay piece C in cavity of wooden design head . 
Press clay into mold as instructed in General Directions . 
Score plain side of C and leave in mold . 
Score one side of disk D , join to C ; ; score other side of D and one side of disk E and join as before . 
While assembled lid is still on design head , gently but firmly press it on plaster board . 
If design head has a deep cavity , clay lid will be quite thick at this point ; ; press eraser of pencil gently 14 " " deep into deep clay to allow vent for proper drying and firing . 
Check fit of lid on jar ; ; if inner lid is too big , trim to fit , allowing room for thickness of glaze . 
Remove lid from head of mold . 
Remove jar from mold . 
Place jar on plaster board with lid in place to dry slowly . 
Bisque fire to cone 08 with lid on jar . 
For an antique effect on jars , brush Creek-Turn brown toner on bisque ware and sponge it off .
