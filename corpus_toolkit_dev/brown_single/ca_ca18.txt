" A Night in New Orleans " is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club .

Mrs. H.J. Grinsfelder is chairman . 
The Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality " and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night " , says Mrs. Grinsfelder , " that is exactly what we expect to offer them . 
We 've been working for weeks . 
The prospects look great . 
We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . 
But we ca n't tell it all now and then have no new excitement later " . 
Basin Street Beat But she does indicate festivities will start early , that a jazz combo will " give with the Basin Street beat " during the cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin 's orchestra will take over during the dancing . 
As for food , Mrs. Henry Louchheim , chairman of this phase , is a globetrotter who knows good food . 
" New Orleans " ? ? 
She says , " of course I 've had the best . 
It is just bad luck that we are having the party in a month with no R 's , so no oysters . 
But we have lots of other New Orleans specialties . 
I know they will be good . 
We 've tried them out on the club chef -- or say , he has tried them out on us and we have selected the best " .
