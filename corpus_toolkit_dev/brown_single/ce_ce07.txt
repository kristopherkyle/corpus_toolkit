The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement . 
In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves . 
The main set of bars are the " tappets " and one tappet is connected to each lever . 
If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time . 
Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars . 
These can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets . 
The number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented . 
In the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called " dogs " . 
Two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar . 
These slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them . 
Here 's how the scheme works : Suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal . 
This also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars . 
The dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets . 
By this scheme , pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal . 
Interlocking signals are normally at stop or " red " position , and a lever must be pulled to " clear " the signal . 
This is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the " plant " . 
There are other basic rules . 
A turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points . 
A signal can not be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked . 
Such locks are nearly always used where the switch points " face " oncoming traffic . 
The lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point . 
If the points are n't thrown all the way , the Turnout can not be locked , and in turn , the signal can not be cleared . 
Generally , these locks on turnouts are called " facing point locks " . 
Figs. 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and signals . 
Each diagram is accompanied by a " dog chart " , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled . 
The lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars . 
By studying the track-signal diagrams you 'll note several other details . 
Derails -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a " stop " signal -- are used in many instances . 
" Home " signals have two blades . 
The blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect -- the blade does not move . 
As an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the " distant " signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant . 
In some low-speed situations , the distant signal is fixed at caution . 
In other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects . 
So much for the prototype . 
The interlocking frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then installed on Paul Larson 's railroad follows the Fig. 1 scheme and is shown beginning in Fig. 7 , page 65 , and in the photos . 
Here 's how it can be built . 
Frame The sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within Fig. 7 , most of the bars being 18 " " brass in 14 " " and 12 " " widths . 
You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish . 
Our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction . 
When cutting the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk . 
Start with the right-hand piece " B " , A[fj] , soldering it to the lower piece " A " of the same material but 12 " " long . 
Let exactly 1 " " of " A " extend beyond " B " and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees . 
Now lay 12 pieces of A[fj] cut 5-34 " " long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 12 " " sq. . This gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece " B " . Compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for " B " . 
Solder this second " B " to " A " at right angles . 
There should be 10 " " between the two parallel members and each should be 1 " " from an end of the long piece . 
Cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a A[fj] bar . 
Tack-solder all the 12 " " sq. pieces to the 10 " " and 12 " " members . 
These will be drilled and tapped later on . 
Now cut five A[fj] locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ) . 
Position these using six intermediate temporary A[fj] spacers and locate the upper 12 " " bar " A " . 
Solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame . 
Now place 12 pieces 12 " " sq. on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5-34 " " long " tappets " , as they are called . 
Cap with a A[fj] bar and tack-solder in place . 
Cap the locking bar spacers with two A[fj] directly under the first two " B " pieces . 
Remove all the loose spacing bars . 
Mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together . 
See Fig. 7 . 
Placement of these holes is not critical , but they should be located so that the centers are about 18 " " from any edge . 
Drill all No. 50 and counter-drill all except the " A " pieces size 43 . 
Tap the " A " pieces 2-56 . 
Now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12 " " and the first two 3-34 " " bars ( " A " and " B " pieces ) , which are soldered together . 
Either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions . 
Dress all surfaces with a file , cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs . 
Drill 20 No. 47 holes in the upper piece " A " as shown in Fig. 7 . 
Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later on . 
Note , 6 and 8 lock levers do n't require holes for contacts . 
Now reassemble the frame , using A[fj] roundhead steel screws and nuts . 
Put the 12 tappets and some A[fj] locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws . 
Be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 12 " " sq. spacer . 
As an anchor for the spring lock , insert a A[fj] bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in Fig. 7 . 
Drill a No. 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw . 
Drill two No. 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2-56 . 
Number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots . 
Remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth . 
Cut five pieces of A[fj] brass bar stock 3-34 " " long . 
These are supporting members for the short locking bars . 
Locate their positions in Fig. 7 and drill No. 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame . 
Cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut . 
Drill four No. 19 and four No. 28 holes in the 12 " " long " A " pieces . 
Locate the position from Fig. 7 . 
Tappets and locking bars Draw-file No. 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends . 
Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer . 
Drill a No. 50 hole 1-14 " " from one end and tap 2-56 . 
( See Fig. 7 . 
) Put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar . 
To find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge . 
Scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 14 " " plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head ( about 564 " " ) away from the frame edge . 
Total distance is about 2164 " " . 
Tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 14 " " tappet movement . 
Drill a No. 50 hole , tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end . 
Drill a No. 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in Figs. 7 and 8 . 
Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars . 
To each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a A[fj] piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs. 6 and 8 . 
These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts . 
Fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times . 
As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible . 
A little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished . 
Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting . 
The order of fitting is not too important . 
However , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back . 
Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar . 
Figs. 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions . 
All the bars are cut from A[fj] brass . 
The lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of Fig. 7 . 
Bar " C " is 2-34 " " long . 
Draw-file the edges , square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame . 
Fig. 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes . 
Center-punch and drill the No. 31 hole 716 " " from one end of the bar . 
Chuck a length of 18 " " dia. drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 18 " " long . 
Cut the piece about 932 " " or 516 " " long and drive it into the No. 31 hole drilled in the locking bar . 
File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 18 " " above the bar . 
This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 . 
Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 . 
Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece " A " . 
See the drawings for the shape of the notch . 
Scribe V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool . 
We used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about " thick and 1 " " dia. fitted on a 18 " " dia. mandrel . 
Such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts . 
File to a smooth finish . 
A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one . 
Endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible . 
The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it . 
Assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces . 
All matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis . 
Chuck a 2 " " or 3 " " piece of 18 " " dia. drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool . 
Fashion a sharp scribing point about 364 " " long on one end , using Swiss pattern files . 
This tool can also be made with a lathe .
