Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E.M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . 
Martin , who has been in office in Washington , D.C. , for 13 months spoke at the council 's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel . 
He told some 350 persons that the United States ' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths . 
" We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours " , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty . 
Patience needed Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union . 
He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , " so long as people rebel , we must not give up " . 
Martin called for patience on the part of Americans . 
" The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build " , he said . 
By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said . 
Individual help best " We have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient " , the assistant secretary said . 
Economically , Martin said , the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves . 
Private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves . 
The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a " social cost " . 
Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country . 
The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland 's civil defense more plans for the city 's schools in event of attack . 
But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow . 
The board members , after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar , 1409 SW Maplecrest Dr. , said they thought they had already been cooperating . 
Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go . 
Dr. Melvin W. Barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would " be more fruitful " , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district . 
" Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster " , he said . 
" Nobody really expects to evacuate . 
I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following . 
Mrs. Molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they " please take a stand " , said , " We must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it would n't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children " . 
Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars " might not be realistic and would not work " . 
Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe 's program . 
The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting . 
It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done .

A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God , in session at the Memorial Coliseum . 
The council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination 's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 . 
The changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible . 
The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible . 
At the adoption , the Rev. T.F. Zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , " The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives " . 
New point added Many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; ; however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list . 
The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads : " The scriptures , both Old and New Testament , are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct " . 
The third belief , in six points , emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ , and : -- emphasizes the Virgin birth -- the sinless life of Christ -- His miracles -- His substitutionary work on the cross -- His bodily resurrection from the dead -- and His exaltation to the right hand of God . 
Super again elected Friday afternoon the Rev. T.F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God . 
His offices are in Springfield , Mo .. Election came on the nominating ballot . 
Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program , " Breakthrough " scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years . 
In his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman , urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program , with " Breakthrough " the theme for the first two years . 
The Rev. R.L. Brandt , national secretary of the home missions department , stressed the need for the first two years ' work . 
" Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church . 
This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life " , he told delegates Friday . 
Church loses pace Talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12,000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-12 minutes , he said " our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge " . 
" In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches " , the Rev. Mr. Brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons . 
" In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois , where we have 200 ; ; 800 in Southern New England , we have 60 ; ; we need 100 in Rhode Island , we have none " , he said . 
To step up the denomination 's program , the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years . 
To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said . 
' church meets change ' " The church 's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour " . 
A capsule view of proposed plans includes : -- Encouraging by every means , all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches . 
-- Engaging mature , experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers . 
-- Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen , who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project ) . 
-- Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6 - 12 months as apprentices in well-established churches . 
U.S. Dist . 
Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland 's insurance fraud trial . 
Denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict . 
In denying motions for dismissal , Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that " a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are " . 
Attorney Dwight L. Schwab , in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy , but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide . 
Proof lack charged Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein 's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied : " It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out " . 
In the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case .
