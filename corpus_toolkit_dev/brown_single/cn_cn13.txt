====
Over his shoulder he could see Max 's loose grin and the Burnsides ' glowering faces . " Honey " , he whispered . " Soon as we send them on their way and make camp , let 's you and me go for a walk down by the Snake -- all by ourselves " . 
====
" Sally " , admonished her mother , " you 've got all evening to visit with Dan . His wounds need dressing now " . 
====
Mrs. Jackson 's words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting . What a spectacle he was , caked with dirt and sweat and blood , filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian , kissing the finest , the sweetest , the bravest , and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world . He released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap . " Got a lot to tend to , but I 'll get back quick as I can " , he assured her . 
====
Dan could hear Clayton Burnside and Eben Jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen . Jackson was doing most of the talking . So long as Sally 's pa was coming out best on the haggle , Dan did n't feel the need of putting in his two-bits ' worth . 
====
Soon as the Burnsides moved on , he 'd lead Rex down by the river ; ; there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening . Damn it , he thought bitterly , picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve . If I had n't got Nate stopped when I did , my duds 'd all be shot plumb to hell ! ! 
====
He stooped , picked up his ruined hat , and pursed his lips thoughtfully . From the way the wound in his head was itching , Dan knew that it would heal . But his only hat was something else again . " Nate ! ! Nate " ! ! He shouted . 
====
The Burnsides , now ready to roll , were purposefully deaf to his cry . 
====
" Nate " ! ! He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him . 
====
" I ai n't going to fight you no more " . Nate turned his head , attempting to speak in a soothing voice . 
====
" I know you ai n't " ! ! Dan affirmed , feeling ten feet tall . He moved in close , jerked the handsome , broad-brimmed beaver hat from Nate 's head and clamped it on his own . " Here 's a present for you " , he said , shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over Nate 's purpling forehead . " Me and you 's trading hats so 's you 'll have something permanent to remember me by " ! ! 
====
Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan . Slipping her hand in his , they silently watched the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight . Much as they had to look forward to , they did n't begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go . 
====
At first Matilda could not believe her own eyes . She had spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness . And now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon . 
====
Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all . Then , with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward sags in her careworn face , Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon " Pa ! ! Pa ! ! I can see Dan . And he 's with the Jacksons " ! ! 
====
" What about Burnsides " ? ? Hez asked , who still believed they 'd have them to lick . 
====
" They ai n't even in sight " ! ! She replied . 
====
By then Hez could see for himself , and so could the others . Soon they were all shouting greetings , exchanging smiles , and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again . But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day . Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , tethered the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires . Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news . No sooner did they hear of Dan 's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action . The wound in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals . From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food . Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of " quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag " . 
====
After their supper , the evening turned into a regular " Hoe-Down " . Only , they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the Virginia Reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration . But with Bill O'Connor on the fiddle , and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting " Glory Be " and " Hallelujah " above their united chant of the lilting old ballads , they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration . 
====
" Golly " , Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators , " do n't that fiddle make you wish the Bible did n't say us Baptists ca n't dance " ? ? 
====
" Nor Methodists , neither " , she replied . " Not that it matters to me , being this far along " . 
====
Rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied . " Come spring , you 'll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too , gal " . 
====
At these words of sympathy and understanding , Harmony said generously , " I do n't mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and join in the games " . 
====
Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply , " I ai n't much of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell , but I 'd sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles " . He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers . " Do n't reckon there 's nobody out there , 'cept maybe Dan , who can outgrip me , Harmony " . 
====
With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff , Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs , and worried about all that might have happened to Sally . And she was deeply thankful that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , youthful circle , skipping and singing , " Farmer in the dell , Farmer in the dell , Heigh-ho the dairy-oh , the farmer in the dell " . 
====
At the sight of Sally 's happy face and carefree expression , Harmony 's dark , brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears . She was glad , completely and unselfishly glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan . And she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they 'd be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod . But she could n't , not yet . Not with the memory of her folks and the lost Conestoga still holding her close . 
====
Out in the center of the circle the farmer , who was Dan , wasted no time when they came to the line , " The farmer choose his wife " . With a swift swoop of his big arms , he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him , and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their " outfit " . Soon the child , the dog , the cat and even the cheese , all joined them out there in the circle . 
====
By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting , or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them . No matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal . Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness . Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains . Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them . 
====
No sooner were they through and the guards posted , than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep . For Matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night . Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first carefree , dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains . 
====
Next morning , they moved on again . 
====
" My souls ' a-gracious " ! ! Gran Harrow exclaimed , watching their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load . " A body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud " ! ! 
====
Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins . " Shucks , Gran " , they said almost in unison . " That was n't nothing at all " ! ! 
====
Leaning forward in her chair , Gran nearsightedly scrutinized Dan 's face . " How 's Sally like rubbin ' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye 're a-raising " ? ? 
====
" Quit ragging him , Gran " , Rod protested . 
====
" I ai n't ragging him " ! ! Gran peered again at the week-old blond mustache shadowing Dan 's upper lip . " But honest-to-Betsy , I 've seed more hair than that on a piece o ' bacon " . 
====
The two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug , placed the chamber pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice . 
====
" Rheumatics worse , Pa " ? ? Dan asked Hez , who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends . 
====
" My right leg 's stiff as a board this morning " , he replied . " But the sun 'll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling " . 
====
The three men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain Clemens ' signal . 
====
Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock , official signboard for the Raft River turnoff , and gloated , " Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar " . 
====
" Wonder what made them hurry so " , Rod drawled , giving Dan a sly wink . 
====
Dan grinned , and changed the subject . " From now on , Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and Rod 's outfit " . 
====
" Ai n't no sense you eating our dust " , Rod protested . 
====
" Sally and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along " , Dan explained . " Jackson recruited his critters , and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up . He 's got the tightest running gear in the train now . Besides , 't- ai n't no more 'n right for me to follow with my black oxen , so 's I can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch " . 
====
Captain Clemens ' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams . 
====
" Reckon ye 're right , Dan " , Hez called back over his shoulder . " I 'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o ' the canyon " . 
====
Rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing , precipice-walled gorge . " We 'll double teams zigzagging up the mountain , Harmony " , he spoke reassuringly , concerned by the pinched look around her mouth . " Like enough we 'll all be up on top by sundown " . 
====
Out of the corner of his eye , he could see his father 's wheels beginning to turn . 
====
Before Harmony had a chance to reply , Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen 's backs .
