-- ( AP ) -- The FBI yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the " Freedom Rider " bus burning trial four weeks ago . 
U.S. Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint , charged that the juror gave false information when asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury . 
He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker , 59 , a farmer of Hartselle , Ala .. Eight men were tried together in U.S. District Court in Anniston , Ala. , on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob 's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders . 
The bus was burned outside Anniston . 
One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal . 
A mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict . 
The arrest of Mr. Parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case . 
The first incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H. Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts . 
He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case . 
Two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial . 
Neither was seated on the jury . 
Then , when the case went to the jury , the judge excused one of the jurors , saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened . 
The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient . 
The judge replaced the juror with an alternate . 
No formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents . 
At the opening of the trial , the jury panel was questioned as a group by Mr. Weaver about Ku Klux Klan connections . 
One member of the panel -- not Mr. Parker -- indicated he had been a member of the KKK at one time . 
He was not seated on the jury . 
The perjury charge against Mr. Parker carries a maximum penalty of $ 2,000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction .
