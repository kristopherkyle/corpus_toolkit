Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . 
The husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . 
It was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight . 
They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . 
Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . 
He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . 
The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday 's opener , and never lagged . 
Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear 's attack . 
After Al Paschal gruonded out , Jay Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe . 
Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left . 
Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert 's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout . 
The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer 's glove . 
Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth . 
Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines ' infield roller accounted for the tallies . 
The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik 's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert . 
Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth . 
Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play . 
Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik 's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base . 
Bingles and bobbles : Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe 's eight hits . 
It was the season 's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order . 
The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark . 
Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ . 
Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage . 
Lefty Wyman Carey , another Denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night . 
Ed Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn . 
Dallas , Tex. , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Kenny Lane of Muskegon , Mich. , world 's seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler , Tex. , here Monday night . 
St. Paul-Minneapolis , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Billy Gardner 's line double , which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field , drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday . 
Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center . 
He came all the way around on Gardner 's hit before 5777 fans . 
It was Gardner 's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year . 
Turk Lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss . 
The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green 's double to left . 
The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly . 
Jim Landis ' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead , but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard . 
Al Smith 's 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and Carreon 's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front . 
A double by Green , Allison 's run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by Lemon and Gardner 's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth . 
Ogden , Utah , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball . 
" I 've had it " , he told a newsman . 
" I know when my reflexes are gone and I 'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club " . 
This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout . 
Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games . 
He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen , awaited . 
She said , when she learned Jackie was heading home : " I 'm just speculating , but I have to think Jack feels he 's hurting Boston 's chances " . 
The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner , City of San Francisco , stopped in Ogden , Utah , for a few minutes . 
Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him . 
The conductor said to Ritchie : " I do n't think you want to talk to him . 
You 'll probably get a ball bat on the head . 
He 's mad at the world " . 
But Jackie had gone into the station . 
Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand . 
" I told him who I was and he was quite cold . 
But he warmed up after a while . 
I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyhole . 
He said he had never talked to Liston " . 
Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston Traveler , who quoted Jensen as saying : " I ca n't hit anymore . 
I ca n't run . 
I ca n't throw . 
Suddenly my reflexes are gone . 
Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . 
And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday . 
Both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . 
Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . 
It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone . 
And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , " Wish I was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer . 
The modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days . 
But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game 's history . 
Yes , with Bob Grove , Carl Hubbell , Herb Pennock , Art Nehf , Vernon Gomez , et al . 
Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player 's ball player , as they say in the trade . 
I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792 . 
" Spahnie does n't know how to merely go through the motions " , remarked Enos Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse . 
The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings . 
Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience . 
Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn 's Ebbetts Field . 
Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies , the Braves ' Joe Adcock , Lou Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on the road . 
Willie 's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle . 
This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you 're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee . 
The record books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace . 
In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases . 
Once the figure was 30-30 . 
Willie 's lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond Mickey 's . 
The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park . 
It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . 
The Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home . 
This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers . 
The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the " Living Room Athletic Club " when games were cut off . 
Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . 
This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here . 
There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise . 
It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level . 
You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy . 
This dissatisfaction led to Howsam 's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . 
Cincinnati , Ohio ( AP ) -- The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . 
With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries , the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game . 
Johnny Blanchard , Mantle 's replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning . 
Hector Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth . 
The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors . 
The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud . 
In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on . 
Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out . 
In the fifth , Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really did n't matter . 
The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager . 
Only Bucky Harris , the " boy-manager " of Washington in 1924 , and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat .
