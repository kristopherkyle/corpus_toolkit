Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . 
Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 a year . 
He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . 
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . 
Williams is a defensive coach . 
Gauer works with the ends . 
Choice was expected The selection had been expected . 
Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry . 
Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . 
Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . 
With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing . 
In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin 's aerials . 
Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing . 
Coach played 3 years Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers . 
An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season . 
He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 . 
He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N. Y .. He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach . 
Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers . 
The Eagles signed him for Shaw 's staff in 1959 . 
Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . 
At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . 
Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . 
With the announcement of a " special achievement award " to William A. ( ( Bill ) Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night 's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter , Baseball Writers ' Association of America , at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . 
Shea , the chairman of Mayor Wagner 's Baseball Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; ; Frank Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; ; Bill Mazeroski , the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates , and Casey Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . 
Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award . 
Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series . 
Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award . 
To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter 's player of the year . 
Show follows ceremonies A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . 
The 53-year-old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York . 
Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . 
His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city . 
The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees . 
Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward . 
When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move here . 
When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey 's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchise . 
The Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand . 
Flushing stadium in works The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson . 
A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick . 
Shea 's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . 
Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands Point , L. I .. Bill Jr. , 20 , Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round out the Shea family . 
Shea was born in Manhattan . 
He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington . 
He played basketball there while working toward a law degree . 
Later , Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians , a minor league professional football team . 
He was the lawyer for Ted Collins ' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League . 
All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday . 
On Friday , Roger Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League 's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy Hamey , the general manager . 
Maris is in line for a big raise . 
Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight . 
The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre . 
Palmer , golf 's leading money-winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin . 
Deane Beman , the National Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards . 
The writers ' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield , N.J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments . 
Horton Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional Golfers Association , will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness . 
The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri . 
Golf 's golden boy Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . 
He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $ 80,738 in prize money . 
He was heralded as " Sportsman of the Year " by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the " Professional Athlete of the Year " , a distinction that earned for him the $ 10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt . 
But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . 
A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole . 
It made him human . 
And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . 
If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . 
It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . 
He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . 
The world 's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . 
He boomed a 280-yard drive . 
Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance . 
No margin for error On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot . 
The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . 
He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds . 
He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side . 
" It is possible that I over-corrected " , he said ruefully . 
Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . 
So he wound up with a dozen . 
" It was a nice round figure , that 12 " , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed . 
From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open . 
The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open . 
Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully . 
Willie 's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count . 
Stickler for rules " How many is that , Jim " ? ? 
Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project . 
" Thirteen " , said Long Jim . 
" Nae , man " , said Willie , " ye must be countin ' the echoes " . 
He had a 16 . 
Palmer 's dozen were honestly earned . 
Nor were there any rules to save him . 
If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . 
This knowledge has come in handy , too . 
His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . 
The ball floated downstream . 
A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie . 
Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association . 
Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . 
" I knew it all along " , confessed Arnold with a grin , " but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there " . 
For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . 
Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . 
He 'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he 's right . 
That 's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . 
It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder . 
Arnold 's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . 
Ruling from on high " I can remove the ball , ca n't I " ? ? 
Asked Palmer of an official . 
" No " , said the official . 
" You must play it where it lies " . 
" You 're wrong " , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . 
" I 'll do as you say , but I 'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling " . 
He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . 
The golfing fathers ruled in his favor . 
So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . 
Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers . 
But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . 
A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today . 
Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football 's hall of fame , players ' benefits and constitutional amendments . 
The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . 
However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . 
Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : " We 'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other " . 
Nine of the league 's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates .
