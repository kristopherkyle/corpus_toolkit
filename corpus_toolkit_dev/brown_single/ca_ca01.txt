The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary election produced " no evidence " that any irregularities took place . 
The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , " deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta " for the manner in which the election was conducted . 
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible " irregularities " in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr .. " Only a relative handful of such reports was received " , the jury said , " considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city " . 
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia 's registration and election laws " are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous " . 
It recommended that Fulton legislators act " to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them " . 
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said " are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments " . 
Merger proposed However , the jury said it believes " these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration " . 
The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , " is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies " . 
It urged that the city " take steps to remedy " this problem . 
Implementation of Georgia 's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . 
It urged that the next Legislature " provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected " . 
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department 's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes . 
" This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program " , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department " has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money . 
The jurors said they realize " a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties " . 
Nevertheless , " we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds " , the jurors said . 
" Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden " on Fulton taxpayers . 
The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary 's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . 
Wards protected The jury said it found the court " has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations " of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee . 
" These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court 's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms " , the jury said . 
Regarding Atlanta 's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended " that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences " . 
The jury did not elaborate , but it added that " there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable " . 
Ask jail deputies On other matters , the jury recommended that : ( 1 ) Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and " a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail " . 
( 2 ) Fulton legislators " work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable " pension plan for city employes . 
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department , the Fulton Tax Commissioner 's Office , the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms , Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department . 
Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , Pearl Williams Hartsfield , in Fulton Superior Court Friday . 
His petition charged mental cruelty . 
The couple was married Aug. 2 , 1913 . 
They have a son , William Berry Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs. J.M. Cheshire of Griffin . 
Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon . 
The petition listed the mayor 's occupation as " attorney " and his age as 71 . 
It listed his wife 's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika , Ala .. The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year . 
The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd. A[fj] . 
Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor 's attorney . 
Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 . 
His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 . 
The mayor 's present term of office expires Jan. 1 . 
He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr. , who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection . 
Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor 's race , a top official said Wednesday . 
Robert Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience . 
State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker . 
In the Blue Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . 
Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to Republicans who attended . 
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents . 
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1 Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2 The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform . 
Sam Caldwell , State Highway Department public relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd 's campaign . 
Caldwell 's resignation had been expected for some time . 
He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years . 
When the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd . 
The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly . 
Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made . 
Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . 
Vandiver likely will mention the $ 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . 
Construction bonds Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . 
The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . 
A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work . 
A revolving fund The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities . 
Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin . 
The Highway Department source told The Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . 
Schley County Rep. B.D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body 's action of Friday in voting itself a $ 10 per day increase in expense allowances . 
Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the " quickie " vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought . 
While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31 . 
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5 . 
As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . 
Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . 
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . 
Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to " endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended " as state funds . 
Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there " are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed " . 
But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . 
The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . 
It says that " in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds " , the State Board of Education should be directed to " give priority " to teacher pay raises . 
Colquitt -- After a long , hot controversy , Miller County has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the " coolest election I ever saw in this county " . 
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix Bush , a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee . 
Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday 's election , and Bush got 402 . 
Ordinary Carey Williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order . 
" This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw " , Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said . 
" Being at the polls was just like being at church . 
I did n't smell a drop of liquor , and we did n't have a bit of trouble " . 
The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however . 
It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence . 
The former county school superintendent , George P. Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board . 
During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls . 
Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . 
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . 
Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise . 
" Everything went real smooth " , the sheriff said . 
" There was n't a bit of trouble " .
